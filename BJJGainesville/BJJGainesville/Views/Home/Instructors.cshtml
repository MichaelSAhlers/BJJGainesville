    <h2>Kon Ying, Owner</h2>
    <p>
        I began studying Brazilian Jiu Jitsu in 2000 at the world famous Renzo Gracie academy in New York City, where I was awarded my blue belt in 2001.  While I quickly became enarmored with this fascinating martial art, I trained sporadically for the next few years, as I was busy juggling a new family (3 young children!), as well working full time and attending Business School.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2006, I received news that Marcelo Garcia, the world famous multiple time BJJ champion was moving to NYC.  Marcelo was my favorite BJJ competitor, as I was astonished by his skill and technique- often times defeating people much larger and heavier than him.  As soon as he moved to NYC, I immediately participated in one of his first classes.  Throughout the class, I could not believe that I shared the mats with Marcelo, as he led the class and participated in the warm ups, drills, and sparring sessions with each of us.  Afterall, this was similar to playing 1 on 1 basketball with Michael Jordan (or Lebron James) in his prime!
    </p>
    <p>
        By late 2006, I received my MBA, and was able to devote more time to practicing  BJJ.  Because Marcelo had made such a huge impact on me during our initial class, I decided to become a student of his.  I received my purple belt on April 22, 2010, and my brown belt on January 16, 2015.  While these belts were a huge honor for me,  I am even more delighted to consider  Marcelo one of of my closest friends.  In addition to his impeccable teaching and skills on the mat, he is an unique example of a humble, kind, and gracious person.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is my sincere hope that my BJJ academy, the Marcelo Garcia Jiu Jitsu Association of Gainesville, will continue to extend Marcelo’s legacy of world class bjj teaching, as well as being a fun, safe, encouraging, and welcoming place for everyone.
